## Terraform foundation

#### Following repository includes examples and explanations of terraform basics, examples of code are provided in respective folders for each category>sub-category. In the folders the following examples are covered, it is encouraged to test everything in your own environment to understand how terrafrom *really* works:
```
* Terraform Blocks
* Terrafrom Variables
* Terraform Resources
* Terraform Datasources
* Terraform functionality
* Other important elements of Terraform
```
#### In folders, examples show are part of AWS Cloud resource deployment/provisioning, but Terraform's real power goes beyond this single Cloud Provider. For testing purposes either AWS, GCP or Azure can be used, the principle stays the same and detailed documentation for each provider is available [here](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers).

### In order to navigate through examples and execute them, there are few perequisites:
#### *Please follow the official installation guides for your respective Operating system*
```
* AWS CLI
* AWS Account
* Terrafrom 
* GitHub
* VS Code
```
# This will be filled with information, TBD
